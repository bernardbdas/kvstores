On March 21st, 2024, Redis announced that it would release the "in-memory data store" under non-free, source available licenses, starting from redis 7.4

Open-source Alternatives:
1. KeyDB
2. Valkey project
3. 


Advantages of using Redis between Server and Client(SQA Agent):

1. Faster Read Operations
2. Reduced Database Load
3. Complex Query Simplification
4. Improved Scalability
5. Temporary Data Storage

Upcoming Challenges:

1. Adds complexity to the architecture
2. Manage the synchronization of data between Redis and MongoDB
3. Determine the volatility and persistence of the data.
4. Handle cache invalidation
5. Ensuring data consistency between the two data stores
6. Plan for high availability and fault tolerance
7. Implement proper security measures to protect your Redis instance
8. Evaluate whether the benefits of caching outweigh the additional network latency.
9. Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms to monitor the health and performance of your Redis instance.


Before making a decision, Factors to consider

1. Requirements of your application
2. The complexity of your MongoDB queries
3. The expected read/write patterns, and the scalability requirements

Conducting performance tests and analyzing the trade-offs can help you make an informed decision.
